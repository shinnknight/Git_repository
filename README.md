The the tasks of Deliverable 1 is to explore the datasets and did data cleaning and munging, 
to prepare data for further modeling.
In the deliverable 1, my team study the relation between bitcoin price and the prices of other 
large commodities like oil, gold and gas.
In the deliverable 2, we applied time series modeling to study the change pattern of bitcoin price. 
We applied several models to train the data, and predict the price, and tested the results using test data.
The effeciency and accuracy of each model is discussed in the 'Deliverable 2.docx'
